## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and modeling exotic hadron data using a combination of classical and quantum computational techniques. The main goals include:

- Generating synthetic data for exotic hadrons (tetraquarks and pentaquarks).
- Fitting the data using Effective Field Theory (EFT) models.
- Performing Bayesian analysis with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to estimate uncertainties.
- Implementing Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) using quantum circuits to explore quantum computing approaches.
- Applying machine learning models to predict hadron data.
- Comparing various models using statistical metrics.
